I have perfect pitch, and I play the flute. The way I perceive sounds is fundamentally different from the way most other people perceive sounds. I can hardly read music, because I never really needed to be able to. I don't even look at the key signature, because I know exactly what sounds "right" and what doesn't. There are, of course, some exceptions to this—but this can be easily overcome by simply listening to the piece I am trying to learn.

So naturally, when I am playing a piece of music, I occasionally get ideas: *"this measure would sound a lot better if we changed the C to a G"*.

I began playing music when I was two years old, starting—as most people do—with the piano. Music never became a particularly notable aspect of my life, but it has certainly always played a part. I can recall three separate instances when I proposed an idea like the one above to a music teacher, and every time, the response was fairly stern—something along the lines of "well, we can't do that because we need to play the song the way its composer intended to".
